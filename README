This is a flow-chart drawing GUI developed for Prof.R.S.Sreenivas' PetriSim Project

Installation:

No specific installation procedures required.  Decompress the folder to the directory as user specified. 
After decompressing, double click on the executable file in /dist folder to launch the GUI


User Instructions:

Things are fairly straightforward.
- To create a place, click on the "place" button on left panel.  Your cursor should turn to 
a hand shaped object, and move the mouse to the canvas area.  Left click in the area you want to
create the place, then type in a name for it, click enter.

- To create a transition, click on the "transition" button on left panel. Similar as the operation
for creating place. In the dialog window type the name of the transition followed by spce " " and
binary number "1" or "0", e.g. "t1 0" or "t1 1". Different colors differentiate 0-transitions and
1-transitions.

    * For Polygon Primitive on the primitive panel, you can do the same operation but do not need
	to provide the name. The Polygon is designed as control point(s) for arrows in the complicated
	flow chart drawing, e.g., when you want draw transitions (sinks) back to the original places(sources)

- To create a arrow, left click on the "arrow" button under primitives panel on left.  Then right click on the 
source primitive, and right click on the destination primitive. A dialog window would pomp up to 
ask the weight bound associates with the arrow.
    * When in the Arrow mode, user can click and hold on to drag the primitives to any places on canvas,
   	the flow chart would adjust accordingly.

- To create a different work area, click on "New work area" button on the top of canvas.

- To delete primitives click on "Edit/Move" button, and then right click on the primitive of you want to delete.
Choose the option of delete. The primitive shape and all the connected arrows would be deleted.

- To compile and output the in/out matrix text file, click on "Compile" button to specify the directory and file-name.
	The format of the output text file:
		1.First number in first row is # of places in the  flow chart. Second number is the # of transitions.
		2.In matrix. From Places to Transitions.
		3.Out matrix. From Transitions to Places
		4.Last line is the type of transitions (0 or 1). Ordered lexicographically.
        * After compilation, a new tab "I/O matrices" would be created to show the same information     
	  as in the output textfile with clear labeling 

- To run some engine on the compiled in/out matrix text files, click on "Run".  You will then need to specify 
3 files:
	1  The analyzer executable, 
	2  The input in/out matrix text file, 
	3. And the name of output text file.  
Program will prompt you three dialog windows for all 3 of these files respectively.


- To create sub graph under each transition, click on Edit/Move button on the left operation panel, move mouse to the
target transition, right click and choose the "new window" option. A new window would be created with two transition
(in and out transitions) fixed in the new window. All the operations on the new sub-window would be identical as the 
above context. So you can generate multi-layed in/out matrices.



- Find the scale adjustment scroller on the toolbar, this can be used to adjust the zoom scale of 
each individual work area.

Save and Load functions are implemented:
To save a drawed graph, click on the "save" icon, on the top left window, the graph would be saved in a 
*.draw file

To reload the saved graph, click on the "Load" icon, on the top left window, the graph saved would be reloaded.
